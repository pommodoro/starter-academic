H﻿i! I am Ricardo Pommer Muñoz, an candidate in Economics at Columbia, working to apply modern behavioral economics models in development contexts and in climate economics. My job market paper threads these three areas by studying the mechanisms by which welfare interventions affect demand for climate insurance and its welfare implications.
